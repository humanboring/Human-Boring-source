# Triangle (The Division VII)

I've just got back from watching [The Danish Girl](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/the-danish-girl/id1063835961?uo=4&at=1000l8mx) in the cinema. Despite criticisms about [not using a trans actor](http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/09/06/the-danish-girl-director-explains-lack-of-trans-actor-in-lead-role/) in the lead role (which I totally agree with), this is an excellent film. Brilliant acting by the two leads, and a really well-made film, this is definitely worth watching.

Today's picture, which is totally unrelated to the film really, is of two pillows and a rug. This is finishing off my first themed photo week, and I quite enjoyed making myself take some different pictures from normal. I'll definitely do it again.
