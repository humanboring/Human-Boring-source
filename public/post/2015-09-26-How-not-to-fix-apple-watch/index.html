    <article>
      <p>David Pogue (relatively) recently made a post on <a href="https://www.yahoo.com/tech/a-humble-proposition-how-to-fix-the-apple-watch-129185196924.html">how to fix the Apple Watch</a>. Now, I’ll fully agree that the Apple Watch isn’t a perfect product - what is? - but theres a few things in the article I take issue with.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Here’s the central problem: Apple went overboard with input mechanisms.</p>

<p>How many ways are there to navigate using a phone’s touchscreen? Four: tap, swipe, tap-and-hold, or pinch.</p>

<p>But on the Apple Watch, there are seven navigation tools: Turn the crown (the knob on the side). Click the crown inward. Tap the side button. Hold in the side button. Tap the screen. Hard-press the screen. Swipe across the screen.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you’re going to include all the different buttons for navigation, then on the iPhone side you really need to include the home button. In this method of counting that’s another three (tap, hold, and double-tap). On the 6S we also now have 3D touch with two levels, but in Pogue’s defence that wasn’t announced at the time the article was written.</p>

<p>If you’re counting, we’re up to a total of 7 for the iPhone (9 for 6s), and 8 for the watch.</p>

<p>He goes on to explain his problems with the spacial navigation, and offer a solution to this.<br />

<p>At first glance, this proposal seems to make sense, however with more thought some problems appear. Scroll up to the notifications. Now you can scroll left or right. So which way to the newest alerts? Which way to the oldest? Why have I just jumped up to somewhere in the middle of my notification timeline?</p>

<p>Ok, back to the watch face. Now if you were to scroll left to the home screen. Now scroll again to the friends screen. Wait, did you swipe across screens, or did you scroll around the home screen?</p>

<p>Now you’ve made it to the friends screen you can go left to some running apps. And you can go right, past the watch face to some apps. Which ones are on which side? Why? Who knows.</p>

<p>I guess the point of this is it’s easy to say things are confusing or need improving, but playing amateur designer isn’t easy. I for sure couldn’t make a better watch, and there’s a reason designer is a paid job.</p>
