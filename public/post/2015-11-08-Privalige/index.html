      <p>Often, people aren&rsquo;t aware of the invisible advantages they have in life, especially when they&rsquo;re white men. This was me for quite a while (and now I&rsquo;m still unaware to an extent).  I have, however, become more aware of the privileges I have in life. Weirdly, my journey to awareness started on Reddit of all places.</p>

<p>I spent much of my teenage years browsing the web, looking for ways to pass the time when I should have been studying or spending time outside. This time-wasting was also how I met my significant other, but that&rsquo;s another story. As a web forum with very little moderation, Reddit inevitably is home to some of the worst aspects of human interaction. Sexism, racism, homophobia and more is common, often presented as a &lsquo;joke&rsquo;. There&rsquo;s a reason that <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/03/18/reddits_ugly_racist_secret_how_it_became_the_most_hateful_space_on_the_internet/">Stormfront and Reddit users have a big overlap</a>.</p>

<p>How reddit works, if you are unaware, is that anybody can post a topic to the site, onto one of the many (mainly user-created) subsections known as &lsquo;subreddits, and then anybody can post a comment on these links. The additional feature of reddit is that people can vote comments and links up or down, and those with the highest gross vote rise to the top. One subreddit that I stumbled upon the website is known as <a href="ww.reddit.com/r/shitredditsays/">&lsquo;Shit Reddit Says&rsquo;</a>, which is dedicated to finding and pointing out the awful comments posted on Reddit with positive votes.</p>

<p>When I first visited this page, I started seeing some of the most awful things other people were posting online. Sexism, racism, homophobia, transphobia - pretty much any bigotry you can imagine was there. The worst thing is, not only did individuals believe the things they were posting, but often hundreds or even thousands of people thought that these comments were good and worth sharing with others.</p>

<p>Seeing some of the worst of humanity (including child-porn apologists and supporters) was a wake-up for me. From this starting point, I make a conscious effort to educate myself. Following the advice of <a href="https://twitter.com/siracusa">John Siracusa</a>, I made a point of following many more women, people of colour, and LGBTQ+ people on twitter<sup class="footnote-ref" id="fnref:98e7f6fdd482aa6021c4b32df07fb368:1"><a rel="footnote" href="#fn:98e7f6fdd482aa6021c4b32df07fb368:1">1</a></sup>, and just read what they have to say. Although I am clearly far from perfect, I am trying to be aware of the advantages I have &ldquo;playing life on <a href="http://kotaku.com/5910857/straight-white-male-the-lowest-difficulty-setting-there-is">easy mode&rdquo;</a>.</p>
