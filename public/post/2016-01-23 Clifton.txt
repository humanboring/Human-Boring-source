# Clifton (The Division VI)

I'm spending this weekend in Bristol, visiting my partner, a trainee nurse. We went on a little trip round the city, ending up at the Clifton Suspension bridge. Walking across the bridge, you had excellent views of the whole of Bristol[^night], and the other side the river Avon stretching towards the sea.

Today's picture is taken from the bridge, at night time.

[^night]: Unfortunately, my iPhone camera wasn't able to get a good picture of the city at night time. I'll have to return there again during the day.
