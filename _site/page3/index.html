    <p>For the past few weeks, I’ve been using a combination of my iPhone and my new iPad Pro for nearly all of my computing needs. The only times I’ve taken my laptop out is when I play games, and when watching videos in the bath. For what I do most of the time (browsing the web, writing short posts, and some very basic image editing), I haven’t missed my laptop once.  iOS is, for me, a better operating system than either Windows or OS X, and the portability of an iPad combined with the larger screen has been great for working. It’s a much more lightweight system, without the decades of cruft is OS X, but with iOS 9 is powerful enough for what I need. I’ve even been able to do some edits to the code behind this website, and created a new icon for the site too, only using my iPad.<sup id="fnref:apps"><a href="#fn:apps" class="footnote">1</a></sup>

    <p>I’ve just got back from watching <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/the-danish-girl/id1063835961?uo=4&amp;at=1000l8mx">The Danish Girl</a> in the cinema. Despite criticisms about <a href="http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2015/09/06/the-danish-girl-director-explains-lack-of-trans-actor-in-lead-role/">not using a trans actor</a> in the lead role (which I totally agree with), this is an excellent film. Brilliant acting by the two leads, and a really well-made film, this is definitely worth watching.

    <p>I’m spending this weekend in Bristol, visiting my partner, a trainee nurse. We went on a little trip round the city, ending up at the Clifton Suspension bridge. Walking across the bridge, you had excellent views of the whole of Bristol<sup id="fnref:night"><a href="#fn:night" class="footnote">1</a></sup>, and the other side the river Avon stretching towards the sea.

    <p>Today I’m driving from London to Bristol. Long journeys are always stressful, monotonous, tiring, and sometimes inspiring.</p>

<p>Whenever I’m travelling, I make sure to bring with me some warm clothes I can easily access. You never know if you’ll need to pop out for a wee on the roadside, or if the car will break down.

    <p><a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104001/">Tron Legacy</a> wasn’t a very good movie, by all accounts. However, it did have one big redeeming feature: the totally amazing soundtrack by Daft Punk. I’m a big soundtrack listener, particularly when I’m working, and the Tron Legacy soundtrack is almost certainly my most frequently listened. Seriously, if you haven’t heard it (and that’s a fair possibility, the film really wasn’t that great), go listen now (<a href="https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/tron-legacy-original-motion/id715635668?uo=4&amp;at=1000l8mx">Apple Music</a> <a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/2GC8kfyiyPjyheUUWyEY8F">Spotify</a>).

    <p>Today was, according to the weather forecasts, one of the coldest days of the year. Tonight will be, at least where I live in the south, possibly the coldest night too. Thankfully, although it’s been cold, it has also been dry. This meant that on the 5km walk I went on today, I only needed to wrap up warm, and not worry about a raincoat as well.

    <p>Green is a colour that can mean very different thing: green trees, green with envy, looking a bit green. For me, the positive associations have always outweighed the negatives.</p>

<p>When looking at the division theme for this week, I’m trying to focus more on contrasts of colour and texture. A photo I took earlier, which I only realised later was out of focus, would have fit this perfectly. However, this photo I thought was interesting, since it is all one colour, with only differences in depth and texture.

    <p>So since I’m entering the fourth week of my photo experiment. At the end of January I’m planning to do a wrap-up post, including my best pictures of the past month, but more on that later. I’ve managed to get 17 days through the year without any sort of plan at the start of the day. To keep me on my toes, I’m setting myself a theme for the next seven days: division<sup id="fnref:division"><a href="#fn:division" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.

    <p>Today has been one of the coldest days of the year. Even at 3pm there was some frost left on the ground, so I know it can’t be much above freezing. Although the cold is refreshing, and can be beautiful, especially on a clear day, it’s always good to get back inside into the warmth. My favourite way of warming back up after being out in the cold is to light the fire. Fire has always held a particular fascination, with the orange and yellow glow of the wood and the plasma flames flickering above.

    <p>This is one of my favourite places in London to visit. When I was younger, I would often head there with my parents, walking on the banks of the Thames or wondering the streets. It’s particularly beautiful at night. Today, since I was going past, I took a photo of the garden of the branch of the Grape and Olive, which is facing out to the river. There was nobody out in the garden this evening, since the weather is finally wintery here (meaning it’s close to freezing, rather than 10°C or so.
