    <p>Spring is truly on the way. I’ve had a relaxing day, since I’m attending an all day interview tomorrow. I will take a picture tomorrow as well to post, but I’m not sure how good it will be.  All depends on how much free time I have.

    <p>I know, a second picture looking upwards in two days. As I was stuck inside an office building a lot of the day, this was the only good picture I managed to get, before my iPhone camera couldn’t cope with the dusk light. Still, I thought this picture was interesting, and is more focused on the manufactured than the natural. The glass entrance to the building provided an interesting frame to one of the few moments of blue sky this afternoon.

    <p>I’ve been getting back into going to the gym regularly, after a bit of a break over Christmas and New Year. I’m not a body builder, and not aiming to be an athlete, but I always feel much better when I’m exercising regularly. It also will keep me healthier, and make me live longer (I hope), which is a nice added bonus.

    <p>Since I’ve reached the end of the first month of my blog, I’ve decided to do another post today, with a countdown of my favourite photos of this month. Onwards to month two!

    <p>So I’ve shared a picture of a chicken, and one of my (now dead) dog on this site, but as of yet no pictures of my cat. This is mainly because, since she is so unsociable, she’s very difficult to take a good photo of. Today’s photo is the best one I could get after a good while of trying.</p>

<p>You may notice I haven’t mentioned her name yet. Back in 2004, when we first got her, we named her ‘Isis’ after the Ancient Egyptian goddess. Unfortunately, that name now has other associations. We haven’t changed her name, and I’m really hoping that no terrorist organisations start using the name of one of my pets again.

    <p>Today, while I was sitting in the kitchen with a cup of coffee, I looked out the back door and spotted today’s picture. The sun was shining, and illuminating the bench in my back garden perfectly, which is unusual for this time of year. The bench is one of the nicest looking benches that I’ve seen, with the flowing shapes and the gentle sky blue colour.

    <p>Metals have been an essential part of human civilisation for thousands of years. The <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic">Chalcolithic</a> era, when humans first started using metal in tools, was around 7000 years ago. However, as useful as metals are, many of the pure, elemental metals, also have properties that make them less useful for us. Copper, the metal first extracted and used by humans, oxidises over time, turning green. It also has a very high melting point, making it difficult to form, and isn’t very malleable, making it difficult to shape into tools.</p>

<p>Very quickly we discovered that by mixing different metals together, it’s possible to make a new material with some of the best properties of the metals put in. In some cases, it can even have properties different from the metals used. For example, brass is more malleable than either the zinc or copper used to make it. Because of this, it has been used in many different areas where the ability to shape the alloy is essential, such as musical instruments.

    <p>I’ve been experimenting with various services and methods to run this website. The first version of Human Boring was run off <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static website system, meaning I would rebuild the website with every new post, but it would be extremely fast to load for readers. The fact I could host the website on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> for free was a draw also.</p>

<p>However, with the update to Jekyll 3.0, GitHub Pages was temporarily incompatible with my blog, and the theme I had based the website on was also outdated. Fortunately, I had backed <a href="https://www.typed.com/">Typed.com</a>, and was able to move to there to run this blog. So far, I’ve stuck with them, due to the excellent (and easily modifiable) built-in themes, and the polish and ease of use. I have experimented with Wordpress also, and have a version of this site running there, but the difficulty of finding a theme I like has kept me away for now.

    <p>Fire has been a part of human history, in life and death, for most of our existence. For thousands of years, people have used a pyre as part of the funeral rights of the dead, taking somebody from this life to the next. The word we use dates back to the ancient Greeks (πυρά), though the practice is much more ancient than even that civilisation. It has had an impact on pop culture also, from the burning Viking boats in historical dramas, to the burning pyre used to honour <a href="http://youtu.be/49ypdyXN3RQ">Darth Vader</a> at the end of Return of the Jedi.
