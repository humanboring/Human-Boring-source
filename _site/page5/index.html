    <p>Another photo taken in the daylight, another photo taken in the park. Today I took a shot of an interesting log, which shows off the macro capabilities of my iPhone 6s+. The sun setting in the background added in some nice colours, especially when blurred.</p>

<p>All my photos so far have been taken using an iPhone 6s+, and edited using the photos app. If I use a different camera, or different editing software, in future, I’ll give details on that post.

    <p>Today is day four of my photo experiment, and the first day I actually remembered to take a photo that was both outdoors and during the daylight.</p>

<p>This photo was taken whilst walking my dog in <a href="https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/bushy-park">Bushy Park</a>, one of the largest parks in London. The sun was just starting to set and the clouds turned a beautiful pink colour.</p>

    <p>Happy birthday to me! I spent the day out in central London with my partner and family, and had a wonderful time despite the rain. We spent lunch in a restaurant in East London called <a href="http://www.8hoxtonsquare.com">8 Hoxton Square</a>. The food was excellent, as were the cocktails we had (especially the bramble).

    <p>Post number two. This is my second nighttime photo as I’ve been not very good at remembering to take photos earlier in the day. I’ll make sure to set a reminder to take tomorrow’s photo during the light tomorrow.

    <p>Today is the first day of the new year. My resolution to myself was to be more active on my blog, since I went through all the trouble of getting it up and running. However, I’m not somebody to whom being active online comes easy.</p>

<p>The solution came when I was browsing the web, as it so often does. I stumbled across the <a href="http://2016photochallenge.com">Pic: 366</a> site, where people are encouraged to post one photo per day of 2016 online. For me, this website will be my location.
