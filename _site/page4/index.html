    <p>I’ve always been interested in music. When I was about 6 I started to play the recorder in school. Not too long after that I began piano lessons, and since then I’ve learned, or taught myself how to play, half a dozen instruments, with varying levels of skill. With the piano as the basis of my musical understanding, and my sight-reading ability, I was able to fairly quickly pick up basic glockenspiel techniques to accompany Christmas songs for my school choir.

    <p>I had a quiet day today, spending as much time with my dog as I can. In the afternoon, I took a nice relaxing bath with bubbles. The pattern the bubbles form in the water has always been something I’ve been interested in. When I was a child I would make a bubble beard, and then mix up “potions” out of bathroom products, much to the annoyance of my parents I’m sure.

    <p>Today, my dog of 12 years was diagnosed with an inoperable tumour in her liver. She had been loosing weight, and had an upset stomach for the past few weeks, but this is still upsetting news. As anyone who has lost a pet knows, it isn’t easy at any age. I’m happy to know that she’s lived 12 happy years with us.</p>

<p>She has come home with us, and we will spend as much time with her as we can. Next week, she will he be put down at home, where at least she can be somewhere she feels safe and comfortable.

    <p>My mother, for several years, has kept chickens in the back garden. There are currently two of them<sup id="fnref:foxes"><a href="#fn:foxes" class="footnote">1</a></sup> living alongside a dog and a cat. It’s interesting that all of my family agree on the pet rankings:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Dog</li>
  <li>Cat</li>
  <li>Chickens</li>
</ol>

<p>Whether this is to do with how often we see then, the amount they react and interact with us, or just the fact that we all love dogs I don’t know.</p>

<p>The photo today is of one of the chickens, in her fox-proof run.

    <p>Most days I walk past a certain wall. Although most walls completely unextraordinary, this one caught my eye. It’s made of rough, uneven bricks of some kind of red stone. This wall is clearly old, as it is covered in patches of crustose lichen<sup id="fnref:fn-lichen"><a href="#fn:fn-lichen" class="footnote">1</a></sup>.</p>

<p>This particular brick had a pattern of raised rock and lichen that looked to me like a cross between a Tyrannosaurus Rex and a <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasaurolophus">Parasaurolophus</a> to me, so I chose it as today’s photo.

    <p>When I first went to university to study Biology, I was much more interested in animals than plants. Although that’s probably still the case, I have come to have a much greater appreciation for plants over the years.</p>

<p>In particular I find mosses and algae fascinating. They’re small (usually<sup id="fnref:fn-moss"><a href="#fn:fn-moss" class="footnote">1</a></sup>) and often overlooked, but are vital for certain ecosystems.</p>

<p>Today’s photo is some moss growing in the top of a wall I spotted whilst walking the dog.

    <p>I originally started writing up a whole different post today. However, when I actually looked at that on my iPad, I realised it was out of focus, and a little bit crappy.</p>

<p>Instead, here is a photo I took this morning, when I was walking to the shop<sup id="fnref:fn-Podcast"><a href="#fn:fn-Podcast" class="footnote">1</a></sup>. Although it’s mid January, and so the middle of winter here in the northern hemisphere, I noticed this flowering plant in somebody’s front garden.

    <p>Today is the end of the working week for most people, and the weekend can’t come soon enough. Today I’ve been comparing excel spreadsheets with invoices, which isn’t the most thrilling task. With any luck, the weekend will bring good weather and some relaxation, along with some good photos.

    <p>Yes, I’m feeling much better today, thank you for asking.</p>

<p>There was some really horrible weather this morning where I live. Wind and rain battering my window woke me up, and was worried I’d be stuck in all day. Thankfully the weather cleared, and by the afternoon it was a beautiful, crisp winter day.</p>

<p>Today’s photo is of the evening sky, with the clouds reflecting the colours of the sunset. The photo that best showed those colours was, unfortunately, out of focus.

    <p>I was sick in bed all day today, so didn’t get up outside to take a photo. My stomach bug was passed to me by family visiting over the new year, but was only really bad today thankfully.</p>

<p>In the end, I took today’s photo from the staircase outside my bedroom. With any luck I’ll be able to get out for tomorrow’s photo.
