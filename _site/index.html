    <p>Today, February 14th, is Valentine’s Day. I’ve spent the day relaxing with my partner, going to the pub, and playing with my new puppy, so it’s been a pretty good day for me. As I gift, rather than chocolates or flowers, I got her a game called <a href="http://www.explodingkittens.com/">Exploding Kittens</a>, which I highly recommend. Although you can play it with only two people, it’s much more fun with a larger group, and I’m looking forward to playing it again.

    <p>I’ve been working further on setting up a site in Jekyll that I can run from iOS. By the end of this weekend I think I’ll have a working setup, and I’ll write up what I did to get it all working.</p>

<p>For today’s picture, I took a photo of my partners hair. She’s dyed it so that there’s a gradient from the natural light brown to a purple colour at the bottom. I love colour gradients in photos, and this one worked well in the natural light from my window.

    <p>Post in the US and UK is managed in a very similar manner in most ways. The big difference between the UK and US is where post is delivered to. In most houses in the US, mail is delivered to a mailbox, a separate box at the front of the property.<sup id="fnref:post"><a href="#fn:post" class="footnote">1</a></sup> In the UK however, almost universally post is delivered to people’s houses through a letter box in the front door.

    <p>Today my mum and I came home with a new puppy. He’s a Wheaton Terrier, who we’ve named Odin. All the pets I’ve had since the age of 7 or 8 have been named after ancient gods (hence the unfortunately named <a href="http://www.humanboring.net/blog/cat">Isis</a>).</p>

<p>We’ve started house training him, as well as getting him to sit, and playing with various new dog toys. He already seems to be settling in, and had a long nap this afternoon on the dog bed beside me. In his, earlier, shorter nap, he went to sleep with his head resting on my foot, as shown in today’s photo.

    <p>When I was 18, I planned to go to university in Brighton. However, since I didn’t quite meet the required grades for entry to the University of Sussex, I ended up going to Swansea University, in Wales, to study. Having spent three years living in Wales, I now have a certain fondness to Welsh culture.</p>

<p>The daffodil is the official national flower of Wales, and is particularly associated with St. David’s day (the feast day of the patron saint of Wales). The vase of daffodils in my house add some colour, and remind me of my time in Wales, both good and bad.

    <p>Every now and then, when walking on the streets round where I live, you might spot a fast-moving flash of green. If you manage to get a closer look, you’ll spot an animal you wouldn’t usually except to see in the cold, rainy British Isles. I am, of course, referring to the Rose-ringed parakeets that live in south-west London. <sup id="fnref:parakeets"><a href="#fn:parakeets" class="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>You can actually see a small group of them in today’s photo, silhouetted against the late afternoon sky. I’d really like to get a closer look in a photo some time this year, as they are particularly beautiful birds. The fact that they’re actually native to <a href="http://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Psittacula-krameri?query=ssp:%22borealis%22">Northern India</a> makes it especially excited to have them so close to me all year round.

    <p>Today has been one of the worst, weather wise, of the year. <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35516741">Storm Imogen</a> has hit the UK, with 96mph winds and 63ft waves. Fortunately for me, the storm isn’t quite as powerful in London, though it has been enough to put me off my planned walk around the park.</p>

<p>Because of the storm, today’s picture is from inside my house. The reflection of my phone is visible between the raindrops, and the white clouded sky. With any luck the storm will have passed by tomorrow, so I can get back outside for tomorrow’s photo.

    <p>When taking pictures for this blog in 2016, I’ve found myself drawn towards pattern and texture, rather than people or action. I love both natural texture, as found in my many close-ups of plants, and the architecture of the city where I live. Today’s photo is one I saw on the way to the cinema. Built into a wall was a set of tiles and holes, forming the pattern seen in the photo. This sort of texture is more common in middle-eastern and Muslim architecture, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it so close to my home.

    <p>This isn’t going to be an in-depth review of the iPad Pro, just my thoughts. It you’re looking for something more detailed, I recommend <a href="https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-review/">this review</a> by Federico Viticci.</p>

<p>I’ve been using the Pro as my full-time computing device for about a month now, with the majority of my gadget time split between this and my iPhone. I can’t say it’s completely replaced my laptop, but 99% of the time, the iPad wins out. Browsing the web is a superior experience in particular, with the large screen that can display a page in landscape or portrait. I’ve never had an issue with slowdowns or stutters (unlike the occasional frame-rate drop I will experience on my iPhone 6 Plus), and have virtually no complaints. I also find iOS suits how I like to work, and have found apps that allow me to do nearly anything I was doing on OS X with equal ease.

    <p>Today I spent nearly all of the day indoors, in a full day of interviews. The interview was in Westminster, know for being the heart of the government in the UK, as well as where the Prime Minister lives. When I left the building, and finally got outside again, the sun was already well on its way down. I took a few photos in central London, and ended up choosing this picture looking from Westminster Bridge down towards the London Eye. The dark clouds made everything look more than a little menacing.
