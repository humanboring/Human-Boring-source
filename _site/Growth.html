  <p>I’ve been experimenting with various services and methods to run this website. The first version of Human Boring was run off <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>, a static website system, meaning I would rebuild the website with every new post, but it would be extremely fast to load for readers. The fact I could host the website on <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> for free was a draw also.</p>

<p>However, with the update to Jekyll 3.0, GitHub Pages was temporarily incompatible with my blog, and the theme I had based the website on was also outdated. Fortunately, I had backed <a href="https://www.typed.com/">Typed.com</a>, and was able to move to there to run this blog. So far, I’ve stuck with them, due to the excellent (and easily modifiable) built-in themes, and the polish and ease of use. I have experimented with Wordpress also, and have a version of this site running there, but the difficulty of finding a theme I like has kept me away for now.

Today’s picture is of a plant I spotted while out walking today. I love the brightness of the green, in contrast to the grey and dull weather we’ve had all week in London.
