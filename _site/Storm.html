  <p>Today I spent nearly all of the day indoors, in a full day of interviews. The interview was in Westminster, know for being the heart of the government in the UK, as well as where the Prime Minister lives. When I left the building, and finally got outside again, the sun was already well on its way down. I took a few photos in central London, and ended up choosing this picture looking from Westminster Bridge down towards the London Eye. The dark clouds made everything look more than a little menacing.

Sorry for the short posts the last few days, but I’ve been either very busy or very tired. Here is today’s picture.

<p>P.S. this is the first post in a long time written on my mac. I’ve booted it up to play <a href="https://xcom.com/">Xcom 2</a>, which I’me very excited to play.</p>
