Today is day four of my photo experiment, and the first day I actually remembered to take a photo that was both outdoors and during the daylight. 

This photo was taken whilst walking my dog in [Bushy Park](https://www.royalparks.org.uk/parks/bushy-park), one of the largest parks in London. The sun was just starting to set and the clouds turned a beautiful pink colour.
