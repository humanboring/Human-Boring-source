Title: Wind Chimes
---
Today I have finally finished re-transitioning my website to be a static site. I'm using a combination of Jekyll, Travis CI, GitHub and AWS to get it all to work, plus [Transmit](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/transmit/id917432930?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000l8mx) and [Working Copy](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/working-copy-powerful-git/id896694807?mt=8&uo=4&at=1000l8mx) on my iPad, and everything seems to work fine. I'll probably write a longer post at some point explaining how everything works. It might not be the simplest way to run a website, but the end result is fast, lightweight, and cheap to run.

Today's picture is of some wind chimes hanging from a bamboo plant in my back garden. After getting more than a little stressed when various parts of my website wouldn't work, relaxing outdoors and listening to the gentle chimes helped to calm me down.
