title: Bamboo

Bamboo is a type of grass that not too long ago would never be seen in my part of the world. Native to multiple continents south of the equator, bamboo species are the [fastest growing](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bamboo#cite_note-Farrelly-4) plants in the world. They're also an amazing natural building material, useful for textiles, as well as a vital food source for the lovable [Giant Panda](http://www.worldwildlife.org/species/giant-panda).

With the sun setting behind this bamboo plant, I took today's photo.
