Today has been one of the coldest days of the year. Even at 3pm there was some frost left on the ground, so I know it can't be much above freezing. Although the cold is refreshing, and can be beautiful, especially on a clear day, it's always good to get back inside into the warmth. My favourite way of warming back up after being out in the cold is to light the fire. Fire has always held a particular fascination, with the orange and yellow glow of the wood and the plasma flames flickering above.

Today's photo is of the log burning stove, shortly after one of the logs caught on fire.
