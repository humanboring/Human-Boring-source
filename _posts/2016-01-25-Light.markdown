For the past few weeks, I've been using a combination of my iPhone and my new iPad Pro for nearly all of my computing needs. The only times I've taken my laptop out is when I play games, and when watching videos in the bath. For what I do most of the time (browsing the web, writing short posts, and some very basic image editing), I haven't missed my laptop once.  iOS is, for me, a better operating system than either Windows or OS X, and the portability of an iPad combined with the larger screen has been great for working. It's a much more lightweight system, without the decades of cruft is OS X, but with iOS 9 is powerful enough for what I need. I've even been able to do some edits to the code behind this website, and created a new icon for the site too, only using my iPad.[^1]

Today's photo is of the lampshade in my house. The lampshade is really interesting, and from this angle cast interesting light and shadows.
