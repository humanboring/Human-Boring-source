Today was, according to the weather forecasts, one of the coldest days of the year. Tonight will be, at least where I live in the south, possibly the coldest night too. Thankfully, although it's been cold, it has also been dry. This meant that on the 5km walk I went on today, I only needed to wrap up warm, and not worry about a raincoat as well.

Today's photo was taken at 12:40 , and there was still a good layer of frost covering the ground. The path cutting through the icy grass provided a good setting for my picture.
