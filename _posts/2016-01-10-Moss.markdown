When I first went to university to study Biology, I was much more interested in animals than plants. Although that's probably still the case, I have come to have a much greater appreciation for plants over the years. 

In particular I find mosses and algae fascinating. They're small (usually[^1]) and often overlooked, but are vital for certain ecosystems. 

Today's photo is some moss growing in the top of a wall I spotted whilst walking the dog.
