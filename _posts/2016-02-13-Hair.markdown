I've been working further on setting up a site in Jekyll that I can run from iOS. By the end of this weekend I think I'll have a working setup, and I'll write up what I did to get it all working. 

For today's picture, I took a photo of my partners hair. She's dyed it so that there's a gradient from the natural light brown to a purple colour at the bottom. I love colour gradients in photos, and this one worked well in the natural light from my window.
