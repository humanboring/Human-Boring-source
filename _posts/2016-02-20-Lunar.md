I'll be honest, today I spent most of the day indoors because of the horrible winter weather, and almost forgot to take today's photo. It was a little last minute, and had to search around my girlfriend's flat to find something at least slightly interesting to take a photo of. With any luck, I'll be heading out to Bristol town centre some time tomorrow, so should be able to take a slightly less boring photo, of something I wouldn't be able to see every day.

Today's photo is of a bath towel, belonging to one of my girlfriend's housemates, hanging on a radiator to dry. The bumpy grey texture reminded me of the aesthetic style: [2001: A Space Odyssey](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/2001-a-space-odyssey/id285993250?uo=4&at=1000l8mx) and [Moon](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/moon/id640049097?uo=4&at=1000l8mx).
