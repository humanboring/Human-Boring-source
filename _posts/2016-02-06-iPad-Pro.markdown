This isn't going to be an in-depth review of the iPad Pro, just my thoughts. It you're looking for something more detailed, I recommend [this review](https://www.macstories.net/stories/ipad-pro-review/) by Federico Viticci.

I've been using the Pro as my full-time computing device for about a month now, with the majority of my gadget time split between this and my iPhone. I can't say it's completely replaced my laptop, but 99% of the time, the iPad wins out. Browsing the web is a superior experience in particular, with the large screen that can display a page in landscape or portrait. I've never had an issue with slowdowns or stutters (unlike the occasional frame-rate drop I will experience on my iPhone 6 Plus), and have virtually no complaints. I also find iOS suits how I like to work, and have found apps that allow me to do nearly anything I was doing on OS X with equal ease.

The two main times I still find myself reaching for the MacBook are when in the bath, or when playing a game. The advantage in gaming is going to stay with an Intel-chipped device that can run Windows for a while yet. When in the bath, the Smart Cover doesn't allow for an angle that allows me to watch TV shows, so that job falls to the MacBook again.
