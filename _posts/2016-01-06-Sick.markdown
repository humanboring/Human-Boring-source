I was sick in bed all day today, so didn't get up outside to take a photo. My stomach bug was passed to me by family visiting over the new year, but was only really bad today thankfully.

In the end, I took today's photo from the staircase outside my bedroom. With any luck I'll be able to get out for tomorrow's photo.
