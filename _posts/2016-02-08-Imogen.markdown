Today has been one of the worst, weather wise, of the year. [Storm Imogen](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35516741) has hit the UK, with 96mph winds and 63ft waves. Fortunately for me, the storm isn't quite as powerful in London, though it has been enough to put me off my planned walk around the park. 

Because of the storm, today's picture is from inside my house. The reflection of my phone is visible between the raindrops, and the white clouded sky. With any luck the storm will have passed by tomorrow, so I can get back outside for tomorrow's photo.
