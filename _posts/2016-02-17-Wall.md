Today's update is going to be a bit short, so sorry about that. It's been freezing cold here today, and I was outside waiting for a bus for 20 minutes, so I spent a lot of the afternoon wrapped up warm and relaxing with a cup of tea.

Today's picture is of a walk I spotted when walking home today. The wall as an imperfect divide between the plantlike and the path made for an interesting shot, plus it was a chance for me to include a photo of my favourite shoes.
