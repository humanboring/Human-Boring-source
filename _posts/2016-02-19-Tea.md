Another say travelling, so going to be a short post again. The weather has been pretty horrible for my whole drive down, meaning now I will have to drive in the rain, darkness, and cold.

Again today, my photo is of a mug of tea. Since I've started drinking weaker tea with no milk (pretty unusual for the UK), I've been able to watch the tea brewing in a bit more detail. The swirling makes surprisingly interesting viewing, and people have even done [studies](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/251287008_Kinetics_and_thermodynamics_of_tea_cream_formation_A_colloidal_approach) on this sort of thing.
