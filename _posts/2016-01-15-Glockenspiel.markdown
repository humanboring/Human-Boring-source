title: Glockenspiel

I've always been interested in music. When I was about 6 I started to play the recorder in school. Not too long after that I began piano lessons, and since then I've learned, or taught myself how to play, half a dozen instruments, with varying levels of skill. With the piano as the basis of my musical understanding, and my sight-reading ability, I was able to fairly quickly pick up basic glockenspiel techniques to accompany Christmas songs for my school choir.

Here is a picture of a glockenspiel [^1] (not my own).

[^1]:	Many people think that this is a xylophone. In fact, a xylophone has wooden bars, that you hit to make the notes. If it has metal bars, it's a glockenspiel, a type of metalophone.
