Every now and then, when walking on the streets round where I live, you might spot a fast-moving flash of green. If you manage to get a closer look, you'll spot an animal you wouldn't usually except to see in the cold, rainy British Isles. I am, of course, referring to the Rose-ringed parakeets that live in south-west London. [^1]

You can actually see a small group of them in today's photo, silhouetted against the late afternoon sky. I'd really like to get a closer look in a photo some time this year, as they are particularly beautiful birds. The fact that they're actually native to [Northern India](http://www.xeno-canto.org/species/Psittacula-krameri?query=ssp:%22borealis%22) makes it especially excited to have them so close to me all year round.
