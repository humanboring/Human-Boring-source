When I was about 14 or 15, I visited Morocco for two weeks. While there, I visited different parts of the country, including Marrakesh [^1], the Atlas Mountains, and several small towns, but the part of the trip that sticks out most in my mind was the night I spent in the Sahara desert.

Our journey started in a small desert town (the name of which I've now long forgotten). From there, we rode on camels into the desert, led by a small group of locals. We travelled for what felt like hours, and shortly after the sun had set we arrived at the camp. 

What really stood out to me was the sky. In a city, like where I live, at night you mostly see the moon, and then maybe a few stars, on a clear night. In the Sahara, with no artificial lights for miles around, hundreds of stars illuminated the camp. I slept in a sleeping bag under those stars. 

In the morning, all I could see around me were the sand dunes of the desert. Today's photo, which is actually of my sofa, brought up memories of that morning in the desert.
