Yes, I'm feeling much better today, thank you for asking.

There was some really horrible weather this morning where I live. Wind and rain battering my window woke me up, and was worried I'd be stuck in all day. Thankfully the weather cleared, and by the afternoon it was a beautiful, crisp winter day.

Today's photo is of the evening sky, with the clouds reflecting the colours of the sunset. The photo that best showed those colours was, unfortunately, out of focus.
