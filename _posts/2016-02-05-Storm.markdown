Today I spent nearly all of the day indoors, in a full day of interviews. The interview was in Westminster, know for being the heart of the government in the UK, as well as where the Prime Minister lives. When I left the building, and finally got outside again, the sun was already well on its way down. I took a few photos in central London, and ended up choosing this picture looking from Westminster Bridge down towards the London Eye. The dark clouds made everything look more than a little menacing.

Sorry for the short posts the last few days, but I’ve been either very busy or very tired. Here is today’s picture.

P.S. this is the first post in a long time written on my mac. I’ve booted it up to play [Xcom 2](https://xcom.com/), which I’me very excited to play.
