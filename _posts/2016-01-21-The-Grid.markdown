title: The Grid

[Tron Legacy](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1104001/) wasn't a very good movie, by all accounts. However, it did have one big redeeming feature: the totally amazing soundtrack by Daft Punk. I'm a big soundtrack listener, particularly when I'm working, and the Tron Legacy soundtrack is almost certainly my most frequently listened. Seriously, if you haven't heard it (and that's a fair possibility, the film really wasn't that great), go listen now ([Apple Music](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/tron-legacy-original-motion/id715635668?uo=4&at=1000l8mx) [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/album/2GC8kfyiyPjyheUUWyEY8F)).

Today's photo is of the plastic grid holding the pebbles in place at a car park. For some reason, it reminded me of Tron.
