Today, the first day of February, is the beginning of the end of Winter. This season is really a time of slumber, rather than distraction, though in some cases death and decay arrive all the same.

My photo today is of a partially destroyed building. In this case, the rubble has be caused by demolition, rather than erosion and decay, but the result is the same. I know this hasn't been the most cheerful post on this website. I'll make sure to have a more cheerful photo for tomorrow, as we make our way to Spring.
