Today I'm driving from London to Bristol. Long journeys are always stressful, monotonous, tiring, and sometimes inspiring. 

Whenever I'm travelling, I make sure to bring with me some warm clothes I can easily access. You never know if you'll need to pop out for a wee on the roadside, or if the car will break down.
