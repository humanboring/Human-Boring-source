Today, my dog of 12 years was diagnosed with an inoperable tumour in her liver. She had been loosing weight, and had an upset stomach for the past few weeks, but this is still upsetting news. As anyone who has lost a pet knows, it isn't easy at any age. I'm happy to know that she's lived 12 happy years with us. 

She has come home with us, and we will spend as much time with her as we can. Next week, she will he be put down at home, where at least she can be somewhere she feels safe and comfortable.

Today's picture is of Gaia, my Irish Terrier. Thank you for all the happy times.
