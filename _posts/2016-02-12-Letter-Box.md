Post in the US and UK is managed in a very similar manner in most ways. The big difference between the UK and US is where post is delivered to. In most houses in the US, mail is delivered to a mailbox, a separate box at the front of the property.[^post] In the UK however, almost universally post is delivered to people's houses through a letter box in the front door.

I spotted a very old and worn example of the typical letter box style found in the UK, though this one was unusually cut into a fence rather than front door.

[^post]: I know that some places in the US use UK style letter boxes too. But very few places in the UK use Mailboxes.
