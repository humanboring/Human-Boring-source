Today's been a quiet day for me, which is always something to enjoy, especially with a new puppy in the house. I spent a lot of the day working on training him, with a break in the afternoon to go to the gym. Tomorrow, I'm going to spend some time working on a bonus post that I want to have completed by this weekend (no promises).

For today's picture, I found a combination of many of the things that have featured in my past shots: strong lines, a combination of organic and man-made, and contrast of colours.
