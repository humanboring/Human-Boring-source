I know, a second picture looking upwards in two days. As I was stuck inside an office building a lot of the day, this was the only good picture I managed to get, before my iPhone camera couldn't cope with the dusk light. Still, I thought this picture was interesting, and is more focused on the manufactured than the natural. The glass entrance to the building provided an interesting frame to one of the few moments of blue sky this afternoon.
