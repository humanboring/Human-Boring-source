So I've shared a picture of a chicken, and one of my (now dead) dog on this site, but as of yet no pictures of my cat. This is mainly because, since she is so unsociable, she's very difficult to take a good photo of. Today's photo is the best one I could get after a good while of trying. 

You may notice I haven't mentioned her name yet. Back in 2004, when we first got her, we named her 'Isis' after the Ancient Egyptian goddess. Unfortunately, that name now has other associations. We haven't changed her name, and I'm really hoping that no terrorist organisations start using the name of one of my pets again.
