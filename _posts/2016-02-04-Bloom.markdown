Spring is truly on the way. I've had a relaxing day, since I'm attending an all day interview tomorrow. I will take a picture tomorrow as well to post, but I'm not sure how good it will be.  All depends on how much free time I have.

Today's picture was taken as the sun was just starting to set. Walking along the street I took many pictures, mainly of plants, but this was my favourite from today.
