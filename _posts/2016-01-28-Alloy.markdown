Metals have been an essential part of human civilisation for thousands of years. The [Chalcolithic](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chalcolithic) era, when humans first started using metal in tools, was around 7000 years ago. However, as useful as metals are, many of the pure, elemental metals, also have properties that make them less useful for us. Copper, the metal first extracted and used by humans, oxidises over time, turning green. It also has a very high melting point, making it difficult to form, and isn't very malleable, making it difficult to shape into tools.

Very quickly we discovered that by mixing different metals together, it's possible to make a new material with some of the best properties of the metals put in. In some cases, it can even have properties different from the metals used. For example, brass is more malleable than either the zinc or copper used to make it. Because of this, it has been used in many different areas where the ability to shape the alloy is essential, such as musical instruments.
