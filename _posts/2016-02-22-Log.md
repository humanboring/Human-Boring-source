I've returned from Bristol, and am now sitting in my living room, iPad on lap and dog at my feet. One thing I always look forward to most after travelling is returning to my own bed to sleep, particularly if I've been sleeping somewhere less than comfortable. Another thing that always brings me comfort on these cold winter nights is the log-burning stove in my house. By this time in the year, out stack of logs in the back garden always starts to run now, but since it's nearly Spring there's no reason to get any more until next winter.

The logs piled on top of each other has something satisfying about it. It's also one of the few things in my house that I haven't yet taken a photo of. Tomorrow I'll take a photo outside my garden again, when I haven't spent hours driving.
