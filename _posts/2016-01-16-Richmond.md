This is one of my favourite places in London to visit. When I was younger, I would often head there with my parents, walking on the banks of the Thames or wondering the streets. It's particularly beautiful at night. Today, since I was going past, I took a photo of the garden of the branch of the Grape and Olive, which is facing out to the river. There was nobody out in the garden this evening, since the weather is finally wintery here (meaning it's close to freezing, rather than 10Â°C or so.

This evening's picture is of the lights illuminating a pub garden on the bank of the River Thames.
