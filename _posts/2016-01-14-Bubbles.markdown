title: Bubbles
---
I had a quiet day today, spending as much time with my dog as I can. In the afternoon, I took a nice relaxing bath with bubbles. The pattern the bubbles form in the water has always been something I've been interested in. When I was a child I would make a bubble beard, and then mix up "potions" out of bathroom products, much to the annoyance of my parents I'm sure.
