Most people have certain songs that are irreversibly linked to certain moments or times in their lives. One of these songs, for me, is Tiny Vessels, and in particular the [demo version](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/tiny-vessels-demo/id721866557?i=721866564&uo=4&app=music&at=1000l8mx) from [Transatlanticism Demos](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/album/transatlanticism-demos/id721866557?uo=4&at=1000l8mx). I enjoy the whole album, though in fairness this is as a big fan of the band, and it might well be less listenable to those less familiar to their back catalogue.

This bright red drain pipe brought to mind this song immediately, as well as the some of the more melancholy memories of my teenage years.
