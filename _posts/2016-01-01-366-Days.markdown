title: 366 Days

Today is the first day of the new year. My resolution to myself was to be more active on my blog, since I went through all the trouble of getting it up and running. However, I'm not somebody to whom being active online comes easy. 

The solution came when I was browsing the web, as it so often does. I stumbled across the [Pic: 366](http://2016photochallenge.com) site, where people are encouraged to post one photo per day of 2016 online. For me, this website will be my location.
