Another photo taken in the daylight, another photo taken in the park. Today I took a shot of an interesting log, which shows off the macro capabilities of my iPhone 6s+. The sun setting in the background added in some nice colours, especially when blurred.

All my photos so far have been taken using an iPhone 6s+, and edited using the photos app. If I use a different camera, or different editing software, in future, I'll give details on that post.
