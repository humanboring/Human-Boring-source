So since I'm entering the fourth week of my photo experiment. At the end of January I'm planning to do a wrap-up post, including my best pictures of the past month, but more on that later. I've managed to get 17 days through the year without any sort of plan at the start of the day. To keep me on my toes, I'm setting myself a theme for the next seven days: division[^1].

Today's picture is from the front gardens of two houses I was walking past. Rather than dividing their property with a wall or a fence, they used two different kinds of rocks. One side opted from slate, and the other pebbles.
