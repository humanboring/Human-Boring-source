title: Chicken
---
My mother, for several years, has kept chickens in the back garden. There are currently two of them[^foxes] living alongside a dog and a cat. It's interesting that all of my family agree on the pet rankings:

1. Dog
2. Cat
3. Chickens

Whether this is to do with how often we see then, the amount they react and interact with us, or just the fact that we all love dogs I don't know.

The photo today is of one of the chickens, in her fox-proof run.

[^foxes]: More than one having died by the jaws of a fox, which is why we bought a fox-proof run.
