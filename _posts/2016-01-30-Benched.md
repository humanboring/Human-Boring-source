Today, while I was sitting in the kitchen with a cup of coffee, I looked out the back door and spotted today's picture. The sun was shining, and illuminating the bench in my back garden perfectly, which is unusual for this time of year. The bench is one of the nicest looking benches that I've seen, with the flowing shapes and the gentle sky blue colour.

Bonus, Puppy. My family is getting a puppy in about two weeks. I'll be sure to post a picture that day, but as a preview, here is a short video of one of his brothers at the dog breeder's house.
