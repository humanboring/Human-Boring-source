Another wet and windy day here in Bristol. I've also been feeling a little under the weather, so again have spent a lot of the day indoors. To make up for it somewhat (and to get a bit closer to reaching my Apple Watch goals), I went for a walk in a nearby park. The route I took ran alongside the [River Frome](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/River_Frome,_Bristol). It almost felt like being in the countryside, with no buildings in site at several points along my route. 

Later this evening I'm going to watch [Spotlight](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/movie/spotlight/id1029633503?uo=4&at=1000l8mx), about which I've heard great things. I'll be sure to say tomorrow what I thought of the film.
