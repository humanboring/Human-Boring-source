title: Texture
---

When taking pictures for this blog in 2016, I've found myself drawn towards pattern and texture, rather than people or action. I love both natural texture, as found in my many close-ups of plants, and the architecture of the city where I live. Today's photo is one I saw on the way to the cinema. Built into a wall was a set of tiles and holes, forming the pattern seen in the photo. This sort of texture is more common in middle-eastern and Muslim architecture, so I was pleasantly surprised to find it so close to my home.
