title: Daffodils

When I was 18, I planned to go to university in Brighton. However, since I didn't quite meet the required grades for entry to the University of Sussex, I ended up going to Swansea University, in Wales, to study. Having spent three years living in Wales, I now have a certain fondness to Welsh culture.

The daffodil is the official national flower of Wales, and is particularly associated with St. David's day (the feast day of the patron saint of Wales). The vase of daffodils in my house add some colour, and remind me of my time in Wales, both good and bad.
