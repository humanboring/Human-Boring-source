title: Pyre
---
Fire has been a part of human history, in life and death, for most of our existence. For thousands of years, people have used a pyre as part of the funeral rights of the dead, taking somebody from this life to the next. The word we use dates back to the ancient Greeks (πυρά), though the practice is much more ancient than even that civilisation. It has had an impact on pop culture also, from the burning Viking boats in historical dramas, to the burning pyre used to honour [Darth Vader](http://youtu.be/49ypdyXN3RQ) at the end of Return of the Jedi.

Using the kindling used for my wood burning stove (see [Fire](http://www.humanboring.net/blog/fire)), I constructed a miniature pyre, which is today's picture.
