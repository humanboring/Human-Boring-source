I've been getting back into going to the gym regularly, after a bit of a break over Christmas and New Year. I'm not a body builder, and not aiming to be an athlete, but I always feel much better when I'm exercising regularly. It also will keep me healthier, and make me live longer (I hope), which is a nice added bonus.

I took today's photo when walking back from the gym this afternoon. Despite being fairly cool, the sun was casting a beautiful light. The photo I end up choosing was one from underneath a tree, looking up towards the sky.
