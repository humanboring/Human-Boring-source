Happy birthday to me! I spent the day out in central London with my partner and family, and had a wonderful time despite the rain. We spent lunch in a restaurant in East London called [8 Hoxton Square](http://www.8hoxtonsquare.com). The food was excellent, as were the cocktails we had (especially the bramble).

My photo for today was of the unusual plate my starter was served on. Unfortunately, I only realised this evening that the picture is a bit blurry.
