Another Friday, another week drawing to an end, and on top of that, the second month of the year is nearly over. I've started drawing up another 'best of' post for February, picking out my favourite photos of this month. I'm now (nearly) two months down, just 10 more to go.

Today's photo shows the border between two rooms, one carpeted and one wooden. On the wood side, the stripes running at 45Â°, and on the carpet you can see my shoes.
