Most days I walk past a certain wall. Although most walls completely unextraordinary, this one caught my eye. It's made of rough, uneven bricks of some kind of red stone. This wall is clearly old, as it is covered in patches of crustose lichen[^fn-lichen].

This particular brick had a pattern of raised rock and lichen that looked to me like a cross between a Tyrannosaurus Rex and a [Parasaurolophus](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasaurolophus) to me, so I chose it as today's photo.

[^fn-lichen]: Have a look [here](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crustose_lichen) for more info, especially if you know more about lichen than me. I'm far from an expert.
