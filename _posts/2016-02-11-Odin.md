Today my mum and I came home with a new puppy. He's a Wheaton Terrier, who we've named Odin. All the pets I've had since the age of 7 or 8 have been named after ancient gods (hence the unfortunately named [Isis](http://www.humanboring.net/blog/cat)).

We've started house training him, as well as getting him to sit, and playing with various new dog toys. He already seems to be settling in, and had a long nap this afternoon on the dog bed beside me. In his, earlier, shorter nap, he went to sleep with his head resting on my foot, as shown in today's photo.
