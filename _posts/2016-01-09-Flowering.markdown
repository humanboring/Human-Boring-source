I originally started writing up a whole different post today. However, when I actually looked at that on my iPad, I realised it was out of focus, and a little bit crappy. 

Instead, here is a photo I took this morning, when I was walking to the shop[^1]. Although it's mid January, and so the middle of winter here in the northern hemisphere, I noticed this flowering plant in somebody's front garden.

[^1]:	As a side note, while taking this photo I was listening to a really excellent Episode of [Reply All](https://gimletmedia.com/show/reply-all/). It's about a family dealing with a child with cancer, and is definite worth a listen. [Here](https://itunes.apple.com/gb/podcast/reply-all/id941907967?mt=2&i=360276006) is a list to the episode on iTunes.
