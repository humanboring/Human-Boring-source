title: Valentine's Day
---
Today, February 14th, is Valentine's Day. I've spent the day relaxing with my partner, going to the pub, and playing with my new puppy, so it's been a pretty good day for me. As I gift, rather than chocolates or flowers, I got her a game called [Exploding Kittens](http://www.explodingkittens.com/), which I highly recommend. Although you can play it with only two people, it's much more fun with a larger group, and I'm looking forward to playing it again.

Today's picture is of my favourite type of flower, the orchid. Flowers are traditionally associated with love (maybe due to the reproductive connection), so it seems particularly appropriate on this day.
