With iOS 9, it became possible to install apps that allow you to block all ads on the internet (but unfortunately not in apps). However, since it's not totally simple to enable them, I made a quick guide, with screenshots. 

First, go to the app store and find your ad-blocker app. I'm using one called [Adamant](http://cocoaapp.com/adamant/) in the screenshots, but it's the same process for any app.

Once the app is downloaded, you'll need to exit to the homescreen and go to the settings page. Scroll until you find the section labled 'Safari', and tap on that. In that screen, there should be an option labled 'Content Blockers'.

Once you've tapped on the 'Content Blockers' lable, you should see the app you downloaded listed. Make sure to flick the switch next to it's name to the green 'on' position.

Some ad-blocker apps might have some settings in the app that you can interact with, and others (like Adamant), are just ready to go at this point. Now you won't see any ads in safari, and should save data ad battery life [while you're at it](http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/10/01/business/cost-of-mobile-ads.html?_r=0).
