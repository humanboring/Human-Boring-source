# Two

Post number two. This is my second nighttime photo as I’ve been not very good at remembering to take photos earlier in the day. I’ll make sure to set a reminder to take tomorrow’s photo during the light tomorrow.

p.s. - I'm still using typed.com as my blog host, as the Jekyll / Github pages setup I was using is no longer compatible with my page setup. I have, at least for now, given up and moved to a simpler platform.
