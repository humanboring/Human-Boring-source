# Green (Division II)

Green is a colour that can mean very different thing: green trees, green with envy, looking a bit green. For me, the positive associations have always outweighed the negatives. 

When looking at the division theme for this week, I’m trying to focus more on contrasts of colour and texture. A photo I took earlier, which I only realised later was out of focus, would have fit this perfectly. However, this photo I thought was interesting, since it is all one colour, with only differences in depth and texture.
Today’s photo is of the top of my green radiator and the green wall behind.
